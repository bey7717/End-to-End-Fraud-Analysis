
################## What is our baseline fraud rate, and how has it changed over time? ############################

Significant Variation: Fraud rates swing from ~0.56% (Week 24) to ~6.17% (Week 43) — nearly an 11x difference.

High-Risk Periods:

Late year (Weeks 43-52): Elevated rates (5.82%-6.17%), likely correlating with holiday shopping season and year-end activity
Week 11: 5.82% fraud rate (February/March)

Low-Risk Periods:

Week 24: 0.56% fraud rate (June)
Weeks 1-2, 16: Under 1.2% fraud rates
Mid-year generally shows lower baseline fraud

Strategic Implications:

Resource allocation: Concentrate fraud monitoring resources during high-risk weeks (11, 43-52)
Threshold tuning: Adjust fraud detection thresholds seasonally rather than using fixed rates
Risk profiling: Use week-based risk scores to flag transactions in high-fraud periods more aggressively
Staffing: Plan investigation teams for peak fraud seasons

###################### Which payment methods have the highest fraud rates relative to volume? ######################

Wallet is the highest-risk payment method (3.68% fraud rate)

Not only has the highest rate, but also the highest absolute fraud count (121 frauds)
This is worth looking into
Card is the safest (2.51% fraud rate)

Lowest fraud rate despite having the most transaction volume (3,423 transactions)
Suggests card payments have better built-in fraud protections

ACH is in the middle (3.11% fraud rate)
Moderately risky, but fewer frauds overall (102)


Volumes are comparable (~3,300 transactions each)
This makes the rate differences meaningful and not due to sampling bias
Each method has sufficient data to trust the patterns


Actionable Recommendations:
Tighten wallet transaction monitoring: Implement stricter velocity checks, device fingerprinting, or transaction limits
Investigate wallet fraud patterns: Are wallet frauds from specific merchants, devices, or geographies?
Leverage card security: Study what makes card payments safer and apply those controls to other methods
Risk-based pricing: Consider adjusting interchange fees or transaction limits based on payment method risk
Customer education: Warn users about wallet fraud risks or require additional verification for wallet transfers

############################## What percentage of fraud comes from cross-country transactions compared to their share of total volume? #####################################


Massive Risk Differential: Cross-country transactions are 4.6x more likely to be fraudulent (9.45% vs 2.03%)

Risk Concentration:

Only 14% of transactions are cross-country
But they account for 43.7% of all fraud (135 out of 309 total frauds)
This is disproportionately high fraud contribution
Actionable Insight: Cross-country transactions should be treated as high-risk by default

Recommended Actions:

Enhanced verification for cross-country transactions (2FA, additional KYC checks)
Stricter limits on transaction amounts for cross-country transfers
Velocity controls on per-user/per-device cross-country frequency
Geolocation verification — flag if user location doesn't match transaction origin/destination
Real-time monitoring with lower thresholds for cross-country fraud scoring

##################################################################################################################

########################## Are higher transaction amounts more likely to be fraudulent? ##########################


Price Range	Fraud Rate	Insight
Very High Price ($301-1000)	3.41% ⚠️ HIGHEST	Transactions above $300 are riskiest
Medium Price ($51-100)	3.37%	Second-highest risk zone
Low Price ($0-50)	3.19%	Moderate risk
High Price ($101-300)	2.73%	Surprisingly LOWEST
Unknown	2.44%	Edge cases with minimal fraud

Tighten Controls on $301-1000 Transactions
Implement mandatory 2FA/OTP for Very High Price purchases
Flag for manual review if combined with other risk factors (cross-country, late-night, high velocity)
Set transaction velocity limits for this tier
Investigate the $101-300 Anomaly

This range has surprisingly LOW fraud (2.73%) despite being substantial
Possible reasons:
Natural friction point where customers verify transactions more carefully
Fraudsters avoid this sweet spot (too visible, not enough payoff)
Action: Keep current controls on this range—they're working
Risk-Based Tiering Strategy

Group transactions into 3 approval tiers:
Tier 1 ($0-100): Standard checks, faster approval
Tier 2 ($101-300): Enhanced verification (your safest zone)
Tier 3 ($301+): Strict controls, higher friction acceptable
Focus Limited Resources

Allocate 40% of fraud prevention efforts to Tier 3
30% to Tier 1 (volume-based)
20% to Tier 2 (already performs well)
10% to edge cases
Monitor the Unknown Category

Investigate what transactions fall into "Unknown" (likely NULL amounts or data entry errors)
Clean data to ensure proper categorization

###########################################################################################################

#################################### Are certain users responsible for multiple fraud attempts? #################################3

1. Priority Alert: user_812 (4 Frauds)
2. High-Risk Cluster: 3-Fraud Users (user_452, user_682, user_984)
3. Volume Problem: 23 Users with 2 Frauds Each



Implement Progressive Friction

After 1st fraud detection → Enhanced verification for 30 days
After 2nd fraud detection → Account suspension + manual review
After 3rd fraud detection → Permanent ban
Cross-Reference Analysis

Check if these repeat offenders share:
Same devices
Same merchants
Same geographic locations
Same payment methods
Could indicate an organized ring rather than isolated incidents
Early Warning System

Flag users approaching 2 frauds (at 1st fraud)
Set alerts for devices/merchants associated with repeat offenders
Block high-risk combinations before next fraud happens
Recovery & Prevention

Contact all 27 users proactively
Provide account security audit
Offer compromised account recovery steps
Monitor reactivated accounts intensely




########################### Are there devices used by multiple users with elevated fraud rates? ##################################


The analysis uncovered a subset of devices that are used by multiple distinct users and demonstrate significantly elevated fraud rates relative to the overall transaction baseline.
Several devices (e.g., device_669 and device_1537) show 100% fraud rates, with every recorded transaction on those devices flagged as fraudulent. 
These devices are characterized by low transaction volume but multiple associated users, a pattern commonly associated with disposable or “burner” devices used for rapid fraud execution.

Other devices (such as device_2722, device_216, and device_186) exhibit moderate to high fraud rates (50–67%) across three to four users, suggesting coordinated activity rather than isolated user behavior. 
These devices represent elevated risk due to both repeated fraud events and user sharing.

A third category of devices (e.g., device_887 and device_1095) shows lower fraud rates (25–40%) but is associated with a larger number of users (up to eight). 
While not immediately block-worthy, these devices warrant monitoring due to their broad user reach and fraud rates that remain well above the dataset average.


Risk Interpretation
The presence of repeated fraud attempts across multiple users on the same device strongly indicates non-independent behavior, consistent with:
Account farming
Credential sharing
Organized fraud operations

Importantly, fraud rate alone is not sufficient for risk determination. 
Devices with lower fraud rates but higher transaction volume may pose greater systemic risk than low-volume devices with extreme fraud rates.

Conclusion
The analysis confirms that shared devices are a meaningful fraud signal. 
Devices used by multiple users with elevated fraud rates should be prioritized for risk scoring, step-up authentication, or blocking, depending on transaction volume and user reach.
Differentiating between burner-style devices and high-reach shared devices enables more effective and targeted fraud mitigation strategies.
